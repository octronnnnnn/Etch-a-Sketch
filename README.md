# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). This browser application allows the user to create and draw on a canvas with different colors. It has an eraser function a reset button and allows for the user to choose the size of the canvas. The focus of this project is on DOM maniupulation, specifically creating elements dynamically through java script.

I revisited this project to add a nice UI, which at this point is not optimized for smaller mobile viewports.
